      <p>For any treatment in India, you need to travel on a medical visa. To get a medical visa, you need to have a visa invitation letter from one of the hospitals.

We will then issue a Visa Invitation Letter from the hospital of your choice. The Visa Invitation Letter is mailed to the Indian Embassy/High Commission/ Consulate in the city where you will be applying, and a copy of the letter will be sent to you for attaching with your visa application.</p>
